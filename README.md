## Source
Data was obtained from file [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) downloaded December 23, 2015.  


## Methodology
Data was processed by combining the test and training files and adding the subject and observation components to the mean and standard deviation set. Only variables that were designated in the documention as mean and standard deviation parts of the analytic calculations were included. The data was then summarised by taking the mean of each variable for each subject/object group.
