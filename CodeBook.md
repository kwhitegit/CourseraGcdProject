## Notes
Data was transformed from file [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) downloaded December 23, 2015.  

Data was processed by combining the test and training files and adding the subject and observation components to the mean and standard deviation set. The data was then summarised by taking the mean of each subject/object group.  

Additional documentation about the base data set can be found within the source zip file or at the provider's website [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## Transformation methodology
Packages data.table and dplyr were used in tidying the data.  

The required file was downloaded from the location mentioned in the Notes section. The individual components were then analyzed and processed as follows.  

File _/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt_ contains the column names for the data measures contained in _/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt_ and _/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt_. Column names were cleaned up to make them easier to read and parse by removing hyphens and parenthesis, placing the axis designator just after the variable name, and moving expanded t (time) and f (frequency) notations to the end of the variable, just before the analytic function (eg. _tBodyAcc-mean()-X_ became _BodyAcc.X.time.mean_).

The observed subjects for each observaton were loaded from _/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt_ and _/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt_ as the foundation of the new dataset.  

Each observation also had a correspondng activity. The activity codes were loaded from _/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt_ and _/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt_ and then decoded to their corresponding labels found in file _/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt_.  

The test dataset was joined together into one object, as was the train dataset, before combining both into one complete set that was written as file _activity_summary.txt_.  

All code used to transform the data is available in _run_analysis.R_.
